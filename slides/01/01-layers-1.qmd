## Data-to-ink ratio {.smaller}

Tufte strongly recommends maximizing the **data-to-ink ratio** this in the Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Tufte, 1983).

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
> Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data---a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design ... \[It\] consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. ... \[It\] is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space ... \[It\] is nearly always multivariate ... And graphical excellence requires telling the truth about the data. (Tufte, 1983, p. 51).

## Discussion

Can you spot the differences between the code here and the one provided in the previous slide? Are there any differences in the resulting plot? Work in a pair (or group) to answer.
:::

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3, color_background = "white")
```

## Global vs. layer-specific aesthetics

-   Aesthetic mappings can be supplied in the initial `ggplot()` call, in individual layers, or in some combination of both.

-   Within each layer, you can add, override, or remove mappings.

-   If you only have one layer in the plot, the way you specify aesthetics doesn't make any difference. However, the distinction is important when you start adding additional layers.

## Activity: Spot the differences II {.smaller}

::: task
Do you expect the following plots to be the same or different? If different, how? Discuss in a pair (or group) without running the code and sketch the resulting plots based on what you think the code will produce.
:::

::: task
## Plot

```{r}
#| label: spot-differences-2
#| fig-show: "hide"

# Plot A
ggplot(tucsonHousing, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = decade_built_cat))

# Plot B
ggplot(tucsonHousing, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue")

# Plot C
ggplot(tucsonHousing, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(color = "#a493ba")
```
:::

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3, color_background = "white")
```

## Wrap up

::: task
Think back to all the plots you saw in the lecture, without flipping back through the slides. Which plot first comes to mind? Describe it in words.
