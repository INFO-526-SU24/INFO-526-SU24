# Warm up

## Announcements

-   Course and TA evaluations
    -   If we can get to \>=90% participation for both, each person gets +5 points on their lowest (not dropped) homework score.
    -   Current participation rate: TA evals 8.5% and course evals 5.9%.
-   Project 1s are posted on the course website. I will remove the scores from the repos after the semester ends.
-   Also posted are your thank you cards and ugly plots!
