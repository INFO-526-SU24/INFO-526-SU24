title: "Thank you"
---

Each of these thank you cards are made in R with ggplot2 by students in STA/ISS 313. A huge thanks to all of our guest speakers!

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Thank you cards created with ggplot2."}
thank_you_paths <- fs::dir_ls("images/thank-you-cards", regexp = "*md", invert = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(thank_you_paths)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(wordcloud2)

words_df <- data.frame(
  word = c("Gracias", "Merci", "תודה", "Danke", "Thank you", "धन्यवाद",  "Obrigado", "شكرًا", "ありがとう"),
  freq = c(30, 24, 20, 15, 16, 21, 12, 10, 09)
)

thank_you_plot <- wordcloud2(words_df)
thank_you_plot
```
