Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the ugliest of them all?

Each of these ugly plots are made in R with ggplot2 by students in INFO 526.

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Ugly plots created with ggplot2."}
thank_you_paths <- fs::dir_ls("images/ugly-plots", regexp = "*md", invert = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(thank_you_paths)
```

```{r}
#| label: ugly-plot-eshaanmathakari
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, palmerpenguins, plotly)
# Create a 3D scatterplot with three variables: bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, and flipper_length_mm
plot_ly(data = penguins, x = ~bill_length_mm, y = ~bill_depth_mm, z = ~flipper_length_mm, 
        type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", 
        marker = list(size = 5, color = "yellow")) %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "Bill Length (mm)"),
                      yaxis = list(title = "Bill Depth (mm)"),
                      zaxis = list(title = "Flipper Length (mm)")),
         title = "3D Scatterplot of Penguin Measurements")
```
